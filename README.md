VSCP Works is a toolbox for VSCP developers and users that is available for Linux and Windows. It can be used to update code in in-house nodes and nodes that sit at a location on the other side of the world. It can be used to view events sent by a node, to configure a node using a high end interface and to simulate a node. New functionality will be added to VSCP Works as needs arise.
